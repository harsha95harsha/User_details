This code basically reads an excel file and extracts data into an object. The file is uploaded into a folder in the working root directory using multer package. The extracted data is uploaded into mongoDB Atlas database and collection. The whole code is written in Node.js and express.js.
It also takes two mandatory fields and checks whether they are present or not. If those mandatory fields are not there, it will throw an error.
